# Password-Strength-Tester-Lab

## Objective

The Password Strength Tester Lab was designed to create an environment for evaluating and improving password security. The project focused on building a tool to assess password strength using common hashing, cracking, and validation techniques. This hands-on experience provided insights into password vulnerabilities, cracking methodologies, and best practices in credential security.

### Skills Learned
-Understanding of password hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256, bcrypt).

-Ability to implement password strength validation logic.

-Experience with password cracking tools and techniques (e.g., dictionary attacks, brute-force).

-Knowledge of credential management best practices.

-Improved scripting and automation skills for security testing.

### Tools Used
-Hashing tools and libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, Pythonâ€™s hashlib).

-Password cracking tools (e.g., Hashcat, John the Ripper) for strength evaluation.

-Custom scripts (e.g., Python or Bash) for password analysis and automation.

-Wordlists (e.g., RockYou.txt) for realistic password testing scenarios.

## Steps
Ref 1: Password Strength Tester Interface

This screenshot displays the user interface of the password strength tester. Users input a password to receive a strength score based on entropy and common patterns.

Ref 2: Dictionary Attack Simulation

A simulated dictionary attack was performed using RockYou.txt to demonstrate how easily weak or common passwords can be cracked.

Ref 3: Entropy Analysis Results

Here, the tester provides feedback on password entropy, helping users understand how randomness and length contribute to strength.

Ref 4: Policy Recommendations

Based on testing results, the tool suggests improvements like using passphrases, avoiding reuse, and increasing character diversity.
